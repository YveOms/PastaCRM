<h1>PastaCRM</h1>
<h2>Short Description</h2>
<p>
    <b>PastaCRM</b> is a customer relationship management system for small IT companies that deal with the creation and management of websites and a computer service.
</p>
<h2>The Idea</h2>
<p>
    Why I've created this CRM? It's simple! Because I wanted to learn developing skills in practise, so I decided to realize bigger project. If anyone have any idea, hint or anything else how to make this CRM better, feel free to tell me this ;]
</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>
    Application works perfectly, but there's some things to do:
    <ul>
        <li><s>add editing options to pricing list</s> (done 04.04.2018),</li>
        <li><s>implementation of PSR standards and JavaScript Standard Style, started using Composer and Semantic Versioning</s> (done 14.06.2018),</li>
        <li>migrate from functions to object oriented programming (OOP).</li>
    </ul>
